Hi!
Thank you for purchase!
If you use Unity version newer than 5.5, you need to re-build the lighting in the demo scene by pressing the Build button in the Lighting window.

If you want to achieve the same visuals as on screenshots and video, check the Color Space settings in Player Settings, it should be set to Linear. Also check the Render Path settings in Graphics Settings, it should be set to Deferred.
Use free Unity 'Post Processing Stack' camera effects (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912) and the adjusted profile for that, which can be founded in QA Modular Parking root folder.

If you have problems with this package, please, let me know mr.andreyvolkov@gmail.com

Don't forget to build your own original levels with this modular kit :)
