# Guiding-To-Available-Parking-Spots-With-AR-device
Parking system: Vehicle enters parking lot, sensor identifies license plate and transmits to server. AR device shows available spaces. A* algorithm guides vehicle using markers. Markers manage spaces, prompt driver. AR displays route and space availability. Last marker offers choices.
The intelligent parking system comprises three stages. The first stage involves the interaction between Arduino devices, sensors installed in the parking area, and the user. The second stage incorporates a cloud service acting as an intermediary between the user and the parking area. The third stage revolves around the user experience, where notifications regarding parking space availability are delivered through a AR device. Sensors are placed in each parking area to detect the number of parking spaces, available parking spaces, and reserved parking spaces. Communication between the AR device and the sensors is facilitated via a WiFi module.

Create a resource group on Azure that includes virtual machines, SQL database servers, and databases. Connect to the database using Azure data studio, paste and run the "ALL database" file. Open the programming environment, make sure you have installed python3 programming environment, Flask, pyodbc plugin, run the 'car park' file code where (server = 'project-server.database.windows.net')
database = 'all
Username = 'user123456789'
Password = 'admin123.') contents need to be modified according to the user's own created database, and finally run http://20.65.176.40:2222/get_data?table=2 in any browser to check whether the database is successfully connected (you can change table = 2 to table = 1/ table = 2/ table = 3/ table = 4 to get multiple views) )

To download and configure Unity, you can follow these steps:

Visit the official Unity website: https://unity.com/. Look for the "Download Unity" button on the homepage or in the menu.

On the download page, choose the Unity version that is suitable for your operating system. Unity provides different versions and license options, so select the one that fits your needs. Click the corresponding download button.

Once the download is complete, double-click the installation package and follow the instructions to install Unity. Depending on your operating system requirements, you may need to enter an administrator password or provide other confirmations.

During the installation process, you can choose the components you want to install. By default, Unity installs the necessary components and common platform supports. If you require additional features or platform support, you can choose custom installation and select the desired components.

Wait for the installation to complete. This may take some time, depending on your computer's performance and the selected components.

After the installation is finished, find the Unity icon in the Start menu or on the desktop and open the Unity Editor.

Once the Unity Editor is open, you may need to create a new project or open an existing one. Follow the prompts on the interface to proceed.

If it is your first time opening Unity, you may be required to log in with your Unity account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free Unity account.

After logging in, you can start using Unity for game development or other projects.

To import a folder into Unity, follow these steps:

1. Open the Unity editor and create a new Unity project or open an existing project.

2. In the Unity Project panel, navigate to the target location where you want to import the folder.

3. Drag and drop the folder from your file explorer or file manager into the Project panel at the desired location. Alternatively, you can right-click in the Project panel, select "Import New Asset" or "Import Folder," and choose the folder you want to import.

4. Unity will automatically process and import all the files within the folder. If the folder contains supported resource types such as textures, models, audio files, etc., Unity will import them as their respective asset types.

5. Once the import is complete, you will see the imported files and folders in the Project panel. You can then drag and drop these resources into your scene or use them for other game development purposes.

Note that when you import a folder into Unity, it creates a copy of the folder and its contents within your Unity project, rather than directly linking to the original folder. Therefore, any changes made to the files within the original folder after importing will not affect the files in your Unity project. If you want to update the imported folder, you'll need to reimport the updated version of the folder.

Additionally, make sure to maintain a well-organized folder structure within Unity for easier management and use of the imported resources.
